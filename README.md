They are a family owned event planning and decorating company.
 my client just wanted bright colors on their website. we were basing it all on balloons,if you look at our pages,backgrounds of balloons,pictures of them,colors of them
 They wanted a specific slogan, but it did not matter where.
 My thought process was just to make it look good and smooth. I also wanted to add some of my own taste.
